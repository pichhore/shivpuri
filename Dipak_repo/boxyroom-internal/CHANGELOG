- Amount ($) stored in properties are in the currency type observed in
  Property.currency_type
- Migration script will change all existing properties currency_type to SGD
- All users' default currency is SGD until otherwise noted
- Some work may be required on app/views/my/properties/new for the monthly
  rental part to ensure that the textfield shrinks in size
  (david's notes: I didn't edit your css because I'm not sure how you intend to
  modify the css)
- currency_type on my/properties/new automatically selects the value based on
  the owner's prefer_currency setting
- To convert values use
  CurrencyExchange.currency_exchange(amt,frm_currency,to_currency)
- http://github.com/jasonfranklin-stokes/currencyexchange
- rake db:migrate is needed
