Marshmallow
===========

Marshmallow is a chat-bot who will connect to your Campfire room and tell you things.
We use him to tell us when someone deploys with Capistrano, when people make feedback
tickets, when we commit a subversion change, and many other purposes.

Have fun!  Patches always appreciated.

Development of Marshmallow was initially sponsored by CollectiveX, Inc: http://collectivex.com


Here are some sample usages:

* Exception notification
* Subversion post-commit notices
* Send feedback from your site straight to the dev chatroom.

You need to edit some files and add your various usernames and password for these to work.
Remember to *create* the usernames if you have a campfire room.
