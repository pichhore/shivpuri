Hopefully things are going well for you!  Let me know if you have any more questions about what we discussed, or would like more information. I would love to help you sell your property. <br/><br/>

                              Everyone is looking for that silver bullet to sell their property in today’s tough real estate market.  Right now owner financing is one of the hottest strategies in the market.  In fact it’s one of my favorite right now given the current situation with the lending market.  Even if you don’t own your home outright, I can show you how you can employ this strategy using the Assignment of Mortgage Payment Systems, AMPS.<br/><br/>

                              Even if that strategy doesn’t work, I literally have a dozen others that might be exactly what you are looking for.  Why don’t you give me a call and we can discuss them.  You can reach me at my direct line, {Company phone}.<br/><br/>

                              In business you have to continually follow up and follow through.  That’s one of the key things that has differentiated me in the past from other investors.  Not only do I know what solutions to offer my clients, I also know how to take care of those final details to make sure everything gets taken care of.  And I consistently take the time to review what needs to be done to close a deal so that everyone’s expectations are met in the end.<br/><br/>

                              That’s the same kind of doggedness that I would apply to your property because that’s the type of investor I am.  <br/><br/>

                              When we last spoke about your property you told me you were going to pursue some other options at that time.  Since we have not talked in a while, hopefully things have worked out well for you. But, if you are still trying to sell the property and would like to explore some of the  options I have for you, let me know, and I would be glad to discuss them and find a win-win solution for you.<br/><br/>

                              Warm Regards,<br/><br/>

                              Today’s market is very difficult and always seems like there are too many sellers (competition) and not enough buyers.  As a result, it’s not uncommon for a property to sit on the market or go through several nit picky buyers.  As an investor, you’ll find I’m not nit picky at all.  <br/><br/>

                              I want to create a solution that works for both us and because time is of the essence, I want to buy quickly.

Since we have not talked in a while, hopefully things have worked out well for you.

                              I have many options at my disposal to help serve you from Assignment of Mortgage Payment, Short sales, cash offers, lease options, traditional listing services with top agents, house swapping and many, many others including combo plans where we implement multiple strategies at the same time.<br/><br/>

                              Right now owner financing is one of the hottest strategies in the market.  In fact it’s one of my favorite right now given the current situation with the lending market.
