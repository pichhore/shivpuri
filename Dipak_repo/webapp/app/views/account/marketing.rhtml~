                Hi, this is John with JSK Properties,
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once a day I search for properties that match the criteria you entered into your profile on my website. I only send an email if I find something. Today, I found one or more that match your available down payment and monthly payment, and the area(s) you specified that you are interested in. Check it out below...
            </div>

            <div style="color:black; padding-top:15px;">
                If any of these properties look interesting to you, give me a call at (512)-555-5555 so that we can talk further and I can arrange to possibly show it to you.
                <br>
                Thanks,

			    Hi {Retail buyer first name},
                            <br/><br/>
                            I saw that you set up your profile on my website and I look forward
                            to helping you find an owner-financed home.<br/><br/>
                            
                            I wanted to send you a quick email since so many buyers I work with
                            aren't exactly sure how owner financing works.  I've found it
                            usually helps if I can help by answering some of the most common
                            questions up front.<br/><br/>
                            
                            I'm sure you'll have questions beyond these here and I'm always
                            available if you want to email or call me so that I can help explain
                            the options you have available.<br/><br/>
                            
                            In the meantime, here is some of the most common questions and
                            answers about buying a home with owner financing.<br/><br/>
                            
                            How does owner financing work?  Owner financing is when the owner
                            of a home is acting as a bank and finances the home to you,
                            typically for 2-5 years which is usually enough time to work on your
                            credit and other issues so that you can obtain traditional financing
                            in order to refinance the loan.<br/><br/>
                            
                            It's important to understand that with owner financing, you will get
                            the deed  to the home and after the warranty deed has been filed,
                            you will be listed in public records as the legal owner.  This also
                            means that you get all of the tax advantages and you have equitable
                            rights to the home, just like you would if you were getting a                            traditional mortgage from a bank.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Owner finance homes sell fairly quickly since there are more buyers
                            looking than there are homes available.   Additionally, most sellers
                            offering owner financing are well versed in the process which means
                            owner financing can be very tricky and risky for a buyer if they are
                            not familiar with all the inner workings of this type of
                            transaction.  As a result, it's vitally important to do your
                            research and work with someone who specializes in this process so
                            that you have reliable guidance and expertise to ensure your
                            interests are protected. <br/><br/>
                            
                            
                            How much down payment do I need?  Down payments will vary.
                            Typically they can start as low as 5% and go as high as 20%, it all
                            depends on the seller.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Are there any specific requirements to qualify to buy an
                            owner finance home?  Owner financing is typically NOT based on
                            credit score or credit history. This allows anyone with a will to
                            own a home, an opportunity for home ownership. Every seller
                            offering owner financing is different, for the most part they are
                            offering financing for those that cannot obtain a mortgage today.                            The single most important requirement to buy an owner finance home
                            is to have a minimum down payment of 5%.  <br/><br/>
                            
                            How quick can we close?  Unlike using conventional lending to buy a
                            home which can take upwards of 45 days just to get through
                            underwriting and to the closing table, owner finance transactions
                            can close in a matter of days.   If the seller is flexible and you
                            are prepared as the buyer, it is possible to start your home search
                            on Monday and be closing and moving in by Friday.<br/><br/>
                            
                            
                            Like I said before, feel free to send me a quick email or give me
                            a call if you have any further questions that I didn't address in
                            this email and I'd be happy to discuss your options with you
                            further.<br/><br/>

				Hi {Retail buyer first name},<br/><br/>
                                A lot of buyers I work with ask me the if I think owner financing
                                is the right way for them to go.  To be honest, it all depends on
                                your particular situation.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I mean, we all know that a major part of the 'American Dream' is
                                home ownership. Yet, as lending guidelines have tightened, home
                                ownership has become increasingly difficult.<br/><br/>
                                
                                For many buyers and possibly you too, this has left you with only
                                one option if you want to buy a home and that's some type of
                                owner financing strategy.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Buyers that can benefit from owner financing are...<br/><br/>
                                
                                - Credit Challenged buyers who may have experienced some late
                                payments, collections or possibly bankruptcy.<br/><br/>
                                
                                - Self Employed Buyers who can't prove their income or have
                                changed jobs recently also have a problem adhering to the strict
                                lending guidelines.<br/><br/>
                                
                                - Traditional Buyers who may have great credit, but they have
                                other issues,  like lack of a 2 year employment history, that
                                prevent them from obtaining a conventional bank loan.<br/><br/>

                                foreign buyers with no social security number and have a hard time
                                obtaining conventional loans in any market.<br/><br/>
                                
                                - Real Estate Investors who have reached the maximum limit of
                                loans that they can get approved for with a traditional lending
                                source.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Additionally, owner financing is great if you can't afford the
                                high closing costs of a conventional loan because you can save
                                thousands of dollars in closing costs when you are using
                                owner financing.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Plus, owner financing is also ideal if you need to move into a
                                home fast.  It can take 30 - 45 days to close using conventional
                                financing, but you can close on a owner finance home in less than
                                a week.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I think that the more appropriate question to ask is, when is
                                owner financing NOT right for me? <br/><br/>
                                
                                My answer to that is that if you are within 6 to 12 months of
                                being able to get a bank loan, and that is your goal, then you need
                                to crunch the numbers and evaluate the home purchase carefully to
                                determine whether this type of purchase strategy is going to
                                benefit you or not.<br/><br/>
                                
                                The biggest factor you'll want to consider is the price and value
                                of the home.  Since you'll be refinancing so soon, you will want to
                                make sure the home is going to appraise or have a clause in the
                                owner finance contract to protect you if it doesn't.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I hope all this info helps!!  I'll chat with you soon.<br/><br/>

				Hi {Retail buyer first name}, <br/><br/>
                                  
                                  I just wanted to send another quick email to review some of the
                                  things you SHOULD be asking when we are out looking at homes.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  We can discuss a lot of this in more detail if you have questions,
                                  but I wanted to get a head start so that you can be thinking about
                                  some of the things that we will want to watch out for.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Question: Do I get the deed?<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  As I mentioned earlier, owner financing transactions do give you
                                  the deed to the home and that is critical for your protection as
                                  the buyer.  Homes that are advertising rent to own, lease option,
                                  land contract etc do not give you the deed.  This is critical for
                                  you to understand to avoid owner finance scams that "say you're
                                  getting full ownership rights" when in fact, legal title is not
                                  being transferred to you at closing.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Question: What liens are on the property?<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  This is an important question because you will want to make sure
                                  all liens that are attached to the property have been fully
                                  disclosed before closing.  there are no other liens attached to
                                  the home except the mortgage.  Some examples of liens that may be
                                  attached to the home other than a mortgage might be judgements,
                                  IRS liens, vendors liens, etc.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  The reason this is so important is because when we close on the
                                  house and title transfers to you, any liens on the property will
                                  transfer with the title which means you are stuck with them.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Of course, we will get a title search done before we close but this
                                  will save us time if we get all of this information up front.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Question: What are the terms of the balloon payment?<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  If you already read my free report, you'll remember that I
                                  discussed making sure you have a loan extension clause and an
                                  appraisal clause in the contract.  These are all terms that are
                                  tied with the balloon payment.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  It's important that we make sure that your balloon is long enough
                                  to get the home refinanced and has the necessary clauses to protect
                                  you from unforeseen issues.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Question: Will I have the right and the time to get a home
                                  inspection?<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Inspections are really important to make sure there isn't anything
                                  seriously wrong with the property that isn't obvious when we go see
                                  the home.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  Whenever we write up an offer, we will want to make sure you have
                                  the opportunity to get an inspection done before you commit any
                                  serious money in a contract.<br/><br/>
                                  
                                  I hope all this information is useful to you.  I am looking forward
                                  to getting you into a home you love!<br/><br/>

				Hi {Retail buyer first name}, <br/><br/>
                                
                                I hope these quick daily emails are helping answer all of your
                                questions about owner financing.  I try to keep them short because
                                I know how valuable all of our time is, so if I haven't addressed
                                anything that you are still wondering about, you can call me
                                anytime or just drop me an email and I'll get back to you as soon
                                as I can.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I think yesterday I emailed you about my list of questions I tell

                                There are so many variables in owner finance transactions and it's
                                all too easy to make extremely fatal mistakes if you don't know what
                                you're doing.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Here are 4 of them, off the top of my head...<br/><br/>

                                There are a couple reasons making your mortgage payment in cash
                                is a fatal mistake.<br/><br/>
                                
                                First, there is no real method of tracking the payment and if you
                                can't track the payment, then you also can't prove you made it.
                                No proof means you also have no legal recourse in case anything
                                gets fishy.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Plus, being able to show and prove your monthly payments is
                                absolutely essential if you want to ever refinance the home.
                                If you can't show that you made consistent on-time payments for
                                a period of 12 months or more, no lender is going to be willing
                                to consider any type of refinance scenario which could leave you
                                in default of your original contract if there is any kind of
                                balloon on your note (which usually there is).<br/><br/>
                                
                                Mistake #2:  Failing to be diligent about getting ready to
                                successfully refinance the home before the balloon expires.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Depending on the contract, not paying attention or more commonly,
                                forgetting about the balloon date could mean you don't get your
                                affairs in order so that you can refinance and if you can't
                                refinance then you'll likely be facing an upcoming foreclosure.<br/><br/>
                                
                                In fact, some sellers may even be hoping to foreclose. There are
                                a couple reasons why foreclosing is sometimes appealing to a seller:<br/><br/>
                                
                                1. Depending on how long you have lived there, the home has likely
                                appreciated in value.<br/><br/>
                                
                                What that means is that the seller can foreclose, keep the equity
                                that accrued since you've been there, they already have your
                                down payment and now they can find a new buyer with another down
                                payment and start the process all over.<br/>
                                
                                2. Credit repair is a pretty lengthy process and it's not an exact
                                science so for the above reasons, it's even more important to plan
                                ahead and ensure you are not exposing yourself to a potential
                                foreclosure down the road.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Mistake #3:  Not hiring a third party servicing company or
                                maintaining communication with the seller to verify that all
                                payments are being made.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Using third party servicing companies is the #1 solution for this
                                one.  These companies not only ensure all payments are made but
                                they will also keep in contact with both parties to update them
                                on a monthly basis.<br/><br/>
                                
                                This helps remove fears on both the buyer and seller side of the
                                transaction and helps ensure that all money is handled and directed
                                to the appropriate parties each month.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Ultimately it's going to be your decision if you use a third party
                                servicing company or not but if you don't, it's imperative that you
                                maintain communication with the seller to verify all monthly
                                payments.<br/><br/>
                                
                                
                                Warm Regards,<br/><br/>

				Hi {Retail buyer first name}, <br/><br/>
                                
                                I hope you're having a great day, I wanted to send a quick email
                                about some important keys to a smooth owner finance transaction.<br/><br/>
                                
                                As with anything in life, having a team of experts in your corner
                                will ensure you don't fall through too many traps and make
                                unnecessary mistakes that could have been prevented.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Owner finance transactions are no exception.  I have created a team
                                of people I work with to get experts in ever field on our side
                                once we find a a home and write up an offer contract.<br/><br/>
                                
                                These people are incredibly important to have in our corner to
                                give you the most leverage and the most protection.<br/><br/>
                                
                                1.  An owner finance specialist.<br/><br/>
                                
                                This one is easy, cause that's me...  :-)<br/><br/>
                                
                                There are many different variations of owner finance transactions
                                and many sellers will SAY they are offering owner financing but in
                                reality, you aren't getting legal title.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Examples of these transactions are things like Land Contracts,
                                Contract For Deed, Installment Contract, Equity Holding Trusts,
                                Rent To Own, Lease Options or Lease Purchase, among others.<br/><br/>
                                
                                By working with someone like me, who specializes in owner financing,
                                I can explain the differences in each of these transactions and
                                offer recommendations to help you make educated decisions on which
                                one might be best for you.<br/><br/>
                                
                                2.  A Lender or mortgage broker.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Having a lender on your team will not only help you win
                                favor with the seller, but it will ensure a higher rate of success in your mission to get refinanced within the terms you agree to in your contract.<br/><br/>
                                
                                This will be especially important when you want to make an offer
                                on a home for the following reason:  If you are competing against
                                any other buyers for the same property, this one thing alone can
                                give you the upper hand.<br/><br/>
                                
                                3.  A Credit repair company.<br/><br/>
                                
                                For anyone who needs help improving their credit, hiring a credit
                                repair company is going to give you more leverage when making an
                                offer on a home.  Plus, it will give you peace of mind.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Many buyers get incredibly overwhelmed with the process of
                                repairing their credit.  They think they can do it on their own but
                                suddenly 2 years have past and they never found the time to sit
                                down, write all the letters and keep up with the timelines of each
                                credit bureau.<br/><br/>
                                
                                On the other hand, buyers who hired credit repair companies to
                                help them were many times in a position to be able to refinance
                                within 12 short months.<br/><br/>
                                
                                4. A Real Estate Attorney.<br/><br/>
                                
                                This is the most important one of all, and rest assured, I have a
                                real estate attorney on my team!  This is absolutely imperative that
                                we are working with an attorney who specializes in these
                                transactions because attorney's who specialize in owner financing
                                will keep up to date on all the state laws and ensure we are all
                                protected.<br/><br/>
                                
                                5.  Title companies.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Most of the time, I do my closings in an attorney's office but it
                                is very important that if we aren't closing at an real estate
                                attorney's office, then we need to close at a title company.
                                Again, this is just another layer of protection for you.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Title companies are required to have licensed closing agents and
                                attorneys on staff and they will act as a neutral third party
                                witness to the contract in case there are any future disputes.<br/><br/>
                                
                                6.	Third-Party Servicing Companies.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I think I mentioned this to you the other day in one of my emails.
                                A  third-party servicing company is responsible for all incoming
                                payments pertaining to the property and they distribute the money
                                to the appropriate parties.  This is the most reliable way to go in
                                any owner finance transaction to protect yourself and be able to
                                track and prove all the payments you have made.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Many companies also maintain escrow accounts and make the annual
                                payments as needed.<br/><br/>
                                
                                What I love most about this is that it takes a ton of
                                responsibility off both the buyer and seller to ensure all parties
                                are abiding by the contract terms.   It also makes it easy for
                                buyers and sellers to follow up on any questions they have to make
                                sure everything is being handled as it should.<br/><br/>
                                
                                7.  Insurance agent.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Working with an insurance agent who knows how to prepare a
                                homeowners insurance binder in an owner finance transactions is
                                absolutely critical.<br/><br/>
                                
                                When you find a property, we are going to discuss the two options
                                you have with homeowner's insurance.  The first will be to add
                                yourself to the existing homeowners insurance policy as an
                                additional insured.<br/><br/>
                                
                                The second option is to acquire your own homeowners insurance
                                policy and list the seller as either the primary loss payee or
                                secondary loss payee depending on if there is an underlying lien.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I personally recommend option #1 for a couple reasons.  First, it's
                                simpler, second, it saves you money at closing and third, there is
                                no real danger of raising any flags with the bank when they see a
                                insurance policy change.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Let me know if any of this raises any questions we haven't
                                discussed yet.<br/><br/>

				Hi {Retail buyer first name}, <br/><br/>
                                
                                How's things going?  We've been so busy, I wanted to hurry up
                                and get this email off to you.<br/><br/>
                                
                                One of the things that has always astounded me was to learn that
                                the #1 fear of most buyers I work with is getting ripped off.<br/><br/>
                                
                                In fact, it's been the buyers I've met before you who inspired
                                me to make sure I was providing valuable information to all my
                                new buyers because they had so many questions and fears of making
                                mistakes.<br/><br/>
                                
                                So that's what I decided to email you about today, but I gotta be
                                quick so here we go...<br/><br/>
                                
                                Tip #1:  We need to make sure a title search is done prior to
                                the purchase.<br/><br/>
                                
                                There are a few reasons this mistake could cost you thousands.
                                First, if the seller doesn't hold legal title and you don't know
                                it, they will take your down payment and later you'll eventually
                                realize you never really were transferred legal title.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Next, the title search will help you discover all the current liens
                                on the home which is something I mentioned to you previously but
                                there's another reason why this is important that we didn't discuss
                                and that is  that we want to make sure that the underlying is not
                                more than the agreed upon purchase terms.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Tip #2:  You don't want to be using the county tax assessment as
                                your benchmark for the homes value.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Even in a good market, this is true.  Home sellers may have fought
                                their taxes in a bad market or in a down market, they may not have
                                protested their taxes.<br/><br/>
                                
                                The best way to determine value on a property is to do a
                                Comparative Market Analysis.  This will take any current actives
                                and recent sold homes into consideration in order to determine
                                today's current market value and this is something I can do for
                                you when we find you a home.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Tip #3:  If you can help it, you really don't want to be making
                                your monthly mortgage payments directly to the seller if there is
                                an underlying lien holder.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I know we have discussed this briefly before but what I didn't
                                tell you is that this used to be a fairly common con for sellers
                                who would sell their home with an underlying lien and use
                                owner financing.<br/><br/>
                                
                                The sellers would not only pocket the buyers down payment, but they
                                would also pocket the monthly mortgage payment and never pay the
                                bank.  This left both parties in a position where they were facing
                                foreclosure, but the seller was leaving with a good amount of the
                                buyer's cash in hand.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Ok, i gotta run but hopefully all this information is really
                                helping you.  Feel free to give me a ring or send me an email
                                if you have any other questions.<br/><br/>

                                all their experiences and owner finance case studies and used
                                those to fill up this book with valuable information about

				Hi {Retail buyer first name},<br/><br/>

                                tips will help us whiz through the entire process with ease:<br/><br/>
                                
                                1.  We need to make sure we've already hooked you with a lender
                                who specializes in owner finance transactions.<br/><br/>
                                
                                They are going to be able to tell you how much home you can afford
                                and how long you need before you are in a position to be able to
                                refinance.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Then we will have them write a letter stating all the above
                                information, just like they would do when they provide a
                                pre-qualification letter to a traditional buyer.  Then we will
                                submit this letter with your offer.<br/><br/>
                                
                                What this will do is it will show the seller how serious you are
                                about getting a home and refinancing it at some point in the
                                future.  It will also help us ensure that in negotiations you don't
                                agree to a contract with a shorter balloon than what you need.<br/><br/>
                                
                                Most buyers don't take this step and if we are in a multi-offer
                                situation (which is common with owner finance homes because homes
                                are scarce), this extra step will give you the upper hand.<br/><br/>
                                
                                2.  We will want to do this same thing with a credit repair company.<br/><br/>
                                
                                We will put the credit repair company info on the buyers
                                application or I can just mention it to the seller.  This extra
                                step will not only set you up to succeed but it will prove your
                                intent on getting your credit back in shape so you can refinance
                                which is something the seller will like to see.<br/><br/>
                                
                                3.  Start gathering documentation that will help support your
                                offer and show your ability to pay.  Here are some examples of
                                what we may need:<br/><br/>
                                
                                -----> Proof of income and employment: Recent pay stubs or tax
                                returns if you are self employed or Bank deposit statements if
                                you get paid in 'creative' ways.<br/><br/>
                                
                                -----> Proof of Funds for Down Payment:  Bank statement or a
                                letter from your bank stating you have enough funds on deposit to
                                cover the down payment.  (Black out your account numbers.)<br/><br/>
                                
                                Owner finance homes are scarce, so if you take the initiative to
                                gather these few things up front, this will get you off on the
                                right foot with the seller, help your approval and negotiations
                                go quickly and possibly even give you the upper hand if you are
                                competing against another buyer's offer.<br/><br/>
                                
                                I'm excited for you and I'm looking forward to getting you into
                                a home! Let me know if I can help you put any of this stuff
                                together so that we are ready to go as soon as you find a home
                                you love.<br/><br/>
