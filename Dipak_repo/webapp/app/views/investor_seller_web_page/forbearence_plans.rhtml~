<p class="top_style_para_seller_website">The best way to keep (not sell) a home when a homeowner has a temporary financial hardship is a forbearance plan.</p>
<p class="style_para_seller_website">A forbearance plan is an agreement made between a lender and the homeowner where the lender allows the homeowner to miss a couple of payments (or forgives a couple of already missed payments) and then requires the homeowner to make up the payments later - in most cases by making payment-and-a-half payments for several months in a row after the missed payments. The re-payment plan can be structured in several ways.</p>

<p class="style_para_seller_website"><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></p>
<p class="style_para_seller_website">The advantage of pursuing a forbearance plan is that it can avoid foreclosure and keep a homeowner in a home that they really can afford – if they can just be given time to catch up on their payments. </p>

<p class="style_para_seller_website">The disadvantage to a forbearance plan is that most people  <br />are either not eligible for these plans, or those that are,are <br /> not able to ever catch up once the payment-and-a-half payments period begin. They just cannot afford the new or continued payments.</p>

<p class="style_para_seller_website">Forbearance plans, if approved, usually delay foreclosure but often don’t permanently prevent it.

<p class="style_para_seller_website"><b>Common Questions About Forbearance Plans</b></p>
<p class="style_para_seller_website"><b>Question:</b> Can anyone get a forbearance plan?</p>
<p class="style_para_seller_website"><b>Answer:</b> No, in most cases the lender will have to review each homeowner's individual circumstance to see if they are eligible. If you miss payments causing a hardship due to a temporary situation (such as a one-time rough spot like a temporary job loss that is now over), then you are more likely to be eligible and the program probably makes sense. If, however, your financial hardship is on-going (such as a loss of income that has not been replaced), a forbearance plan probably won't be approved, and won't do any good anyway. In these situations, other selling options are often better.</p><br>
