Hello <%=@to_name%>,

A friend, <%=@from_name%>, has invited you to check out a new website called Dwellgo, which can best be described as online dating for Real Estate.  Dwellgo enables Owners and Buyers to be intelligently matched based on the criteria of the property and buyer profile. Owners and Buyers are then able to communicate privately, revealing personal information only when ready.  Best of all, Dwellgo is Free.

Dwellgo currently has over 1100 profiles in the Austin Metro area and is now celebrating our official launch with an exciting contest to bring even more people into the Dwellgo community.
